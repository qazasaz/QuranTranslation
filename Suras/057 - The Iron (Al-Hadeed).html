57:4</a> He is the One who created the heavens and the earth in six days, then assumed all authority. He knows everything that enters into the earth, and everything that comes out of it, and everything that comes down from the sky, and everything that climbs into it. He is with you wherever you may be. GOD is Seer of everything you do.

57:10</a> Why do you not spend in the cause of GOD, when GOD possesses all wealth in the heavens and the earth? Distinguished from the rest are those among you who spend before the victory and strive. They attain a greater rank than those who spend after the victory and strive. For each, GOD promises salvation. GOD is Cognizant of everything you do.

57:13</a> On that day, the hypocrite men and women will say to those who believed, "Please allow us to absorb some of your light." It will be said, "Go back behind you, and seek light." A barrier will be set up between them, whose gate separates mercy on the inner side, from retribution on the outer side.

57:14</a> They will call upon them, "Were we not with you?" They will answer, "Yes, but you cheated your souls, hesitated, doubted, and became misled by wishful thinking, until GOD's judgment came. You were diverted from GOD by illusions.

57:16</a> Is it not time for those who believed to open up their hearts for GOD's message, and the truth that is revealed herein? They should not be like the followers of previous scriptures whose hearts became hardened with time and, therefore, many of them turned wicked.

57:19</a> Those who believed in GOD and His Messengers are the saints and martyrs. Their rewards and their light are reserved for them at their Lord. As for those who disbelieved and rejected our revelations, they are the residents of Hell.

57:20</a> Know that this worldly life is no more than play and games, vanity and boasting among you, and hoarding of money and children. It is like abundant rain that produces plants and pleases the disbelievers. But then the plants turn into useless hay, and flies away. In the Hereafter there is either severe retribution, or forgiveness from GOD and approval. This worldly life is no more than a temporary illusion.

57:21</a> Therefore, you shall race towards forgiveness from your Lord, and a Paradise whose width encompasses the heaven and the earth. It awaits those who believed in GOD and His Messengers. Such is GOD's grace that He bestows upon whomever He wills. GOD is Possessor of Infinite Grace.

57:23</a> Thus, you should not grieve over anything you miss, nor be proud of anything He has bestowed upon you. GOD does not love those who are boastful, proud.

57:25</a> Definitely, we sent our Messengers supported by clear proofs, and we sent down to them the scripture and the law, that the people may uphold justice. And we sent down the iron, wherein there is strength, and many benefits for the people. All this in order for GOD to distinguish those who would support Him and His Messengers, on faith. GOD is Powerful, Almighty.

57:26</a> Indeed, we sent Noah and Abraham, and we granted their descendants prophethood and the scripture. Some of them were guided, while many were wicked.

57:27</a> Subsequent to them, we sent our Messengers. Then we sent Jesus the son of Mary, and we gave him the Injeel (Gospel), and we placed in the hearts of his followers kindness and mercy. But they invented hermitism which we never decreed for them. They should have upheld the commandments approved by GOD. But they did not uphold it as they should have. Therefore, we gave those who believed among them their recompense, while many of them were wicked.

57:28</a> O you who believe, you shall reverence GOD and believe in His Messenger. He will then grant you double the reward from His mercy, endow you with light to guide you, and forgive you. GOD is Forgiver, Most Merciful.

57:29</a> Therefore, the followers of previous scripture should know that they have not monopolized GOD's grace, and that all grace is in GOD's hand. He bestows it upon whomever He wills. GOD is Possessor of Infinite Grace.
