58:0</a> In the Name of GOD, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.

58:1</a> GOD has heard the utterances of the woman who debated with you about her husband, and complained to GOD. GOD heard everything the two of you discussed. GOD is Hearer, Seer.

</span></span>
<br>
<span id="2"class="ayet"><span name="58"class="sure"><span style="font-size:22px;">&#160;</span><br><a href="http://en.sonahit.com/p/58.html?m=1#2">

58:2</a> Those among you who estrange their wives (as their mothers) know full well that they are not their mothers. Their mothers are the ones who gave birth to them. Surely, they are committing a blasphemy and a falsehood. GOD is Pardoner, Forgiver.

</span></span>
<br>
<span id="3"class="ayet"><span name="58"class="sure"><span style="font-size:22px;">&#160;</span><br><a href="http://en.sonahit.com/p/58.html?m=1#3">

58:3</a> Those who estrange their wives in this manner, then reconcile thereafter, shall atone by freeing a slave before resuming their sexual relations. This is to enlighten you. GOD is Cognizant of everything you do.

</span></span>

58:4</a> If you can't find a slave to free, you shall fast two consecutive months before resuming sexual relations. If you can't fast, then you shall feed sixty poor people. You shall believe in GOD and His Messenger. These are GOD's laws. The disbelievers have incurred a painful retribution.

</span></span>

58:5</a> Surely, those who fight GOD and His Messenger are committed to defeat, like their previous counterparts were committed to defeat. We have sent down clear proofs, and the disbelievers have incurred a shameful retribution.

58:6</a> The day will come when GOD will resurrect them all, then inform them of everything they had done. GOD has recorded everything, while they have forgotten it. GOD witnesses all things.

58:7</a> Do you not realize that GOD knows everything in the heavens and everything on earth? No three people can conspire secretly without Him being their fourth, nor five without Him being the sixth, nor less than that, nor more, without Him being there with them wherever they may be. Then, on the Resurrection Day, He will inform them of everything they had done. GOD is fully aware of all things.

58:8</a> Have you noted those who were enjoined from conspiring secretly, then insist on what they were enjoined? They conspire to commit sin, transgression, and disobedience of the Messenger. When they come to you, they greet you with a greeting other than that decreed by GOD. They say inside themselves, "GOD will not punish us for our utterances." Their only requital is Gehenna, wherein they burn; what a miserable destiny.

</span></span>
<br>
<span id="9"class="ayet"><span name="58"class="sure"><span style="font-size:22px;">&#160;</span><br><a href="http://en.sonahit.com/p/58.html?m=1#9">

58:9</a> O you who believe, if you have to confer secretly, you shall not confer to commit sin, transgression, and to disobey the Messenger. You shall confer to work righteousness and piety. You shall reverence GOD, before whom you will be summoned.

</span></span>
<br>
<span id="10"class="ayet"><span name="58"class="sure"><span style="font-size:22px;">&#160;</span><br><a href="http://en.sonahit.com/p/58.html?m=1#10">

58:10</a> Secret conspiracy is only by the Devil, in order that he seeks to hurt those who believed. However, he can't hurt them against GOD's will. In GOD the believers shall trust.

</span></span>

<span id="11"class="ayet"><span name="58"class="sure"><span style="font-size:22px;">&#160;</span><br><a href="http://en.sonahit.com/p/58.html?m=1#11">

58:11</a> O you who believe, if you are told in the meetings, "Please make room." you shall make room. GOD will then make room for you. If you are asked to get up and move, get up and move. GOD raises those among you who believe, and those who acquire knowledge to higher ranks. GOD is fully Cognizant of everything you do.

</span></span>

58:12</a> O you who believe, when you wish to confer with the Messenger, you shall offer a charity (to the poor) before you confer. This is better for you, and purer. If you can't afford it, then GOD is Forgiver, Most Merciful.

</span></span>
<br>
<span id="13"class="ayet"><span name="58"class="sure"><span style="font-size:22px;">&#160;</span><br><a href="http://en.sonahit.com/p/58.html?m=1#13">

58:13</a> If you failed to give to charity before conferring, then repented thereafter, GOD accepts it. You shall observe the Contact prayers, give the Obligatory Charity, and obey GOD and His Messenger. GOD is fully Cognizant of everything you do.

58:14</a> Have you noted those who befriended people with whom GOD is angry? They neither belong with you, nor with them. They deliberately swear lies!

</span></span>
<br>
<span id="15"class="ayet"><span name="58"class="sure"><span style="font-size:22px;">&#160;</span><br><a href="http://en.sonahit.com/p/58.html?m=1#15">

58:15</a> GOD has prepared for them a severe retribution. Miserable indeed is what they used to do.

58:16</a> They used their oaths as a means of repelling from the path of GOD. Therefore, they have incurred a shameful retribution.

58:17</a> Neither their money, nor their children will help them against GOD. They are the residents of hellfire, wherein they stay forever.

<span id="18"class="ayet"><span name="58"class="sure"><span style="font-size:22px;">&#160;</span><br><a href="http://en.sonahit.com/p/58.html?m=1#18">

58:18</a> The Day will come when GOD resurrects them all. They will swear to Him then, just as they swear to you now, thinking that they really are right! Surely, they are the real liars.

</span></span>
<br>
<span id="19"class="ayet"><span name="58"class="sure"><span style="font-size:22px;">&#160;</span><br><a href="http://en.sonahit.com/p/58.html?m=1#19">

58:19</a> Satan has possessed them, and has caused them to disregard GOD's message. These are the party of Satan. Absolutely, the party of Satan are the losers.

58:22</a> You will not find people who believe in GOD and the Last Day befriending those who oppose GOD and His Messenger, even if they were their parents, or their children, or their siblings, or their relatives. For these, He decrees faith into their hearts, and supports them with inspiration from Him, and admits them into gardens with flowing streams wherein they stay forever. GOD is pleased with them, and they are pleased with Him. These are the party of GOD. Absolutely, the party of GOD are the winners.
