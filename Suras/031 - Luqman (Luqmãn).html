31:10</a> He created the heavens without pillars that you can see. He established on earth stabilizers (mountains) lest it tumbles with you, and He spread on it all kinds of creatures. We send down from the sky water to grow all kinds of beautiful plants.

31:12</a> Indeed, we have endowed Luqman with wisdom; "You shall be appreciative of GOD." Whoever is appreciative is appreciative for his own good. As for those who turn unappreciative, GOD is in no need, Praiseworthy.

31:32</a> When violent waves surround them, they implore GOD, sincerely devoting their prayers only to Him. But as soon as He saves them to the shore, some of them revert. None discards our revelations except those who are betrayers, unappreciative.
