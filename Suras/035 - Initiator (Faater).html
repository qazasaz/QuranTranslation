35:1</a> Praise be to GOD, Initiator of the heavens and the earth, and appointer of the Angels to be Messengers with wings - two, three, and four (wings). He increases the creation as He wills. GOD is Omnipotent.

35:3</a> O people, remember GOD's blessings upon you. Is there any creator other than GOD who provides for you from the heaven and the earth? There is no other god beside Him. How could you deviate?

35:8</a> Note the one whose evil work is adorned in his eyes, he still thinks that it is righteous. GOD thus sends astray whomever He wills, and He guides whomever He wills. Therefore, do not grieve over them. GOD is fully aware of everything they do.

35:9</a> GOD is the One who sends the winds to stir up clouds, then we drive them towards barren lands, and revive such lands after they were dead. Such is the resurrection.

35:10</a> Anyone seeking dignity should know that all dignity belongs to GOD. To Him ascends the good words, and He exalts the righteous works. As for those who scheme evil works, they incur severe retribution; the scheming of such ones is destined to fail.

35:11</a> GOD created you from dust, then from a single cell, then He causes you to reproduce through your spouses. No female becomes pregnant, nor gives birth, without His knowledge. No one survives for a long life, and no one's life is snapped short, except in accordance with actual record. This is easy for GOD.

35:12</a> The two seas are not the same; one is fresh and delicious, while the other is salty and undrinkable. From each of them you eat tender meat, and extract jewelry to wear. And you see the ships sailing through them, seeking His provisions, that you may be appreciative.

35:13</a> He merges the night into the day, and merges the day into the night. He has committed the sun and the moon to run for a predetermined period of time. Such is GOD your Lord; to Him belongs all kingship. Any idols you set up beside Him do not possess as much as a seed's shell.

35:14</a> If you call on them, they can't hear you. Even if they hear you, they can't respond to you. On the Resurrection Day, they will disown your idolizing. None can inform you like Most Cognizant.

35:18</a> No soul can carry the sins of another soul. If a soul that is loaded with sins implores another to bear part of its load, no other one can carry any part of it, even if they were related. The only people to heed your warnings are those who reverence their Lord, even when alone in their privacy, and observe the Contact Prayers. Whoever purifies his soul, does so for his own good. To GOD is the final destiny.

35:39</a> He is the One who made you inheritors of the earth. Then, whoever chooses to disbelieve, disbelieving gives damage to himself. The disbelief of the disbelievers only augments their Lord's abhorrence towards them. The disbelief of the disbelievers plunges them deeper into loss.

35:40</a> Say, "Consider the idols you have set up beside GOD; show me what on earth have they created." Do they own any partnership in the heavens? Have we given them a book wherein there is clear proof? In fact, what the transgressors promise one another is no more than an illusion.

35:43</a> They resorted to arrogance on earth, and evil scheming, and the evil schemes only backfire on those who make them.
